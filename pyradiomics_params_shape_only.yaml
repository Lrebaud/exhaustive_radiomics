    #Resegmentation
    #Segmented voxels outside the resegmentRange are removed from the mask prior to feature calculation. When the value is 
    #None(default), no resegmentation is performed. When resegmentShape is False, only first order and texture classes are
    #calculated using the resegmented mask.
